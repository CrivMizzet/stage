							<h2>Micromanaging can be soul draining…</h2>
							<p>I am approachable and dependable with a talent for fostering a positive, collaborative work environment. Skilled at resolving conflicts with fairness and tact. I have a high record of keeping operations running smoothly and efficiently. I have the confidence to make well-informed decisions that support both business goals and team well-being. I am absolutely dedicated to maintaining harmony in the workplace while keeping operations running smoothly and efficiently.</p>

							<div class="example-box">
								<p><strong>Job:</strong> <strong><u>Safety/Jan-San Distribution</u></strong><br>
								<strong>Issue:</strong> An employee over-ordered non-refundable custom safety vests.<br>
								<strong>Solution:</strong> Contacted the customer about the surplus and offered the same bulk-order discount, resulting in the sale of the overage and full cost recovery.<br>
								<strong>Outcome:</strong> Avoided a $4,000 loss and implemented a double-signature purchasing system for custom items to prevent future errors.</p>
							</div>

							<div class="example-box">
								<p><strong>Job:</strong> <strong><u>3PL Logistics</u></strong><br>

								<strong>Solution:</strong> Facilitated a meeting to voice team concerns about the abrupt leadership change.<br>
								<strong>Outcome:</strong> Launched an open-floor, team-building day that sparked dynamic discussions and drove ideas for improving productivity.</p>
							</div>

							<div class="example-box">
								<p><strong>Job:</strong> <strong><u>Substance Abuse Rehabilitation Center</u></strong><br>
								<strong>Issue:</strong> Senior counselor had difficulty understanding modern slang, creating a barrier with younger patients.<br>
								<strong>Solution:</strong> Created a study sheet of current terms and meanings.<br>
								<strong>Outcome:</strong> Improved communication and built stronger rapport with younger, initially less trusting, patients.</p>

							<h2>Five Star Reviews</h2>

							<blockquote>
								<p>"She's an exceptional leader that actually has your back! I've known her for 8 years, and her genuine kindness makes her a standout professional. She approaches every challenge with a calm, resourceful attitude. Her ability to balance efficiency with empathy fosters strong team relationships and creates a workplace where people feel valued and motivated." <strong>— Coworker, 2025</strong></p>
							</blockquote>

							<blockquote>
								<p>"As a hospice nurse, I was profoundly moved by her unwavering support for a grieving family after a tragic loss. Even if she was 'just dispatch', her quiet presence, respect for their privacy, and genuine care embodied the very heart of hospice work." <strong>—Colleague, 2024</strong></p>
							</blockquote>

							<blockquote>
								<p>"I'm deeply grateful to her for going above and beyond to help me transition into a payment plan so that I could continue my treatment. She didn't have to step in, but her kindness and dedication made a real difference. Not only did it allow me to stay focused on my sobriety, but I also cleared my medical debt within a month's time." <strong>—Patient, 2009</strong></p>
							</blockquote>

							<blockquote>
								<p>"I've known her longer and better than most. I started my first job with her, and by the end of our junior year in high school, she was being offered supervisor and training positions. If anyone has a can-do attitude, it's 1000% her!" <strong>—Friend, 15+ years</strong></p>

							<h2>Work Style &amp; Interpersonal Skill</h2>

							<h4>"Do you prefer working independently or as part of a team?"</h4>
							<p>No preference—I find independent work easier to excel in, but group work is more satisfying because you get to see everyone succeed.</p>

							<h4>"How do you stay organized and manage your time effectively?"</h4>
							<p>I prefer to color code my work space with levels of importance. This helps with time management so that I can quickly see the next task. I also like to create a "Today List" (not to be confused with a "To Do" list) so that there's a visual queue.</p>

							<h4>"What role do you typically take in a group project?"</h4>
							<p>The leader/planner—I tend to fall into the groups that need clear plans to thrive. I aim to see the vision before it is enacted.</p>

							<h4>"How do you handle conflicts with team members?"</h4>
							<p>I like to mediate handwritten letter sit-downs with all parties. My personal motto is: "If you don't care enough to take the time to write it down, then you're actually fine with the way things are." It's not easy to fix something if everyone is only working to defend themselves. This also keeps a written log of conflict which will be easier to gauge for their future with the company.</p>

							<h4>"Can you describe a time when you had to adapt to a significant change?"</h4>
							<p>After a massive storm, the internet connection from our provider was unavailable. I was able to create a personal hotspot from my cellphone so that my team could finish a bid before the deadline. I then called our local library to confirm space for 20 teammates so that everyone had an opportunity to properly close out their day.</p>

							<h4>"What are your strengths and weaknesses?"</h4>
							<p>Strengths: leadership, curiosity, and bravery. Disgruntled customer? Bring it. Can I learn something from this? Show me. Are you hiring? Let's do this. Weakness: I hate leaving things undone.</p>
